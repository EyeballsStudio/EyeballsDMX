DMX library for the Eyeballs Studio DMX shields

This is the library for my Arduino DMX shields. It builds upon the Conceptinetix library for reading and decoding DMX data streams.
For information about my DMX shields, visit my blog at http://eyeballs-studio.blogspot.com

Known issues:
- Servo.h has to be included in your Arduino sketch (even if it doesn't use servos)
